As you might have guessed, this is no ordinary run of the middle common place anus. Sea cucumbers have a cloaca. Think of it as a multipurpose orifice for breathing, pooping, mating, and any other orifice related needs you might have - convenient, not what I would have chosen personally, but I'm quite happy with my arrangement. I'm a man who likes a bit of distance between the breathing and the pooping, but no judgments.
